# kubetnl

kubetnl (*kube tunnel*) is a command line utility to tunnel TCP connections from within a Kubernetes to a cluster-external endpoint, e.g. to your local machine.
You can think of it as doing the opposite of `kubectl port-forward`.

## Demo

![kubetnl-demo.gif](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fischor/6d175f01db8ded817d5fc72dcd37811e/raw/d5a708324354b49fa5dd15c47f9fd52287c394e1/kubetnl.gif)

## How does it work

When a new tunnel with `kubetnl tunnel myservice 8080:8080 9090:9090 5.5.5.5:80:8888` is created, kubetnl will create a Service and a Pod with name "myservice" in your cluster.
The pod will expose port 8080, 9090, 8888 and another random port for the tunnel.
The service will target port 8080, 9090 and 8888 of the pod.

Once the pod is running, a connection to the pods exposed port for tunneling is established via pod portforwarding.
Using the established connection to the pod, kubetnl opens a tunnel on the pod causing it to forward any incoming connections on port 8080, 9090 and 8888 to the kubetnl binary.
From the kubetnl binary, the connections are then forwarded to their specified target endpoints.

## Installation

### Install using `go install`

If you have Go installed, you can simply run

```
go install github.com/pschmitt/kubetnl@latest
```

to install the latest version of kubetnl. 
You can replace latest with the version tag you want to install, e.g. `v0.1.1`.

### Install by picking a relase

Go the the [release section](https://github.com/pschmitt/kubetnl/releases) and pick the binary for your operation system and architecture and add it to your PATH.

## Prerequisities

For kubetnl to work, you need to have privilidges the create services and pods and to do portforwarding on pods. 
Your cluster must also be able to pull the docker.io/fischor/kubetnl-server image. 


## Commands

### `kubetnl --help`

Basic commands
  tunnel      Setup a new tunnel
  cleanup     Delete all resources created by kubetnl

Other Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  version     Print the kubetnl version

Usage:
  kubetnl [flags] [options]

Use "kubetnl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
```

### `kubetnl tunnel --help`

```sh
$ kubetnl tunnel --help
Setup a new tunnel.

 A tunnel forwards connections directed to a Kubernetes Service port within a cluster to an endpoint outside of the
cluster, e.g. to your local machine.

 Under the hood "kubetnl tunnel" creates a new service and pod that expose the specified ports. Any incoming connections
to an exposed port of the newly created service/pod will be tunneled to the endpoint specified for that port.

 "kubetnl tunnel" runs in the foreground. To stop press CTRL+C once. This will gracefully shutdown all active
connections and cleanup the created resources in the cluster before exiting.

Examples:
  # Tunnel to local port 8080 from myservice.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:80.
  kubetnl tunnel myservice 8080:80

  # Tunnel to 10.10.10.10:3333 from myservice.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:80.
  kubetnl tunnel myservice 10.10.10.10:3333:80

  # Tunnel to local port 8080 from myservice.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:80 and to local port 9090 from myservice.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:90.
  kubetnl tunnel myservice 8080:80 9090:90

  # Tunnel to local port 80 from myservice.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:80 using version 0.1.0 of the kubetnl server
image.
  kubetnl tunnel --image docker.io/fischor/kubetnl-server:0.1.0 myservice 80:80

Options:
      --image='docker.io/fischor/kubetnl-server:0.1.0': The container image thats get deployed to serve a SSH server

Usage:
  kubetnl tunnel SERVICE_NAME TARGET_ADDR:SERVICE_PORT [...[TARGET_ADDR:SERVICE_PORT]] [flags] [options]

Use "kubetnl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
